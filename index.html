    <div class="book-detail-content"><span class="wordsDot" id="chapter__1"></span><span class="title">Chapter 1 - A Rainfall of Footsteps</span><br><br>Rhonda:<br><br>A gentle breeze carried the smell of the ocean and just a hint of winter chill. The moon was nearly full. Her glow added a silver lining to the silhouettes of trees. It gave an ethereal glow to the old tarmac road winding its way up the mountains. The sound of birds and the symphony of cicadas quelled as the roar of an engine grew louder. Soon headlights pierced the night. There was a squeal of rubber as the old Mustang fishtailed wildly around the hairpin turns. Peels of laughter and surf rock climbed up over the revving of the monstrous motor.<br><br>"Whoo!" shouted Rhonda. "Say Duke, you sure know how to handle this heap!" The top was down and her auburn hair was a halo of brown flames leaping about her head. Duke's muscles strained beneath his tight t-shirt. His veins bulged in his temple, but his face was relaxed and easy. Teeth as white as polished pearls glinted from his open smile. He shifted gears, revving the engine like a bandit making off with all the gold in Fort Knox.<br><br>"Baby, you ain't seen nothing yet!" he called over to her. "Get <span class="wordsDot" id="read_words__200"></span> an eyeful of this!"<br><br>The road was climbing higher and higher, giving a breathtaking views. The glittering city lights spread out below like constellations in the inky blackness of the jungle and the dark shimmering sea. A sign for a scenic overlook whooshed. Then came yellow signs screaming about the dangers of falling rocks and sharp turns. They suggested a speed limit that might have been 25 miles per hour, but flashed by too fast to read.<br><br>Up around the next turn, the narrow road steepened and appeared to turn into a ramp leading straight up into the cloudless sky.<br><br>"DUKE!" Rhonda wailed. "Duke LOOK OUT!!!" The tachometer swung up right and left. Duke punched it into high gear, slamming he and Rhonda back into their slick leather seats like astronauts making for the moon. The car was slurping up asphalt like linguine and the ledge to oblivion was coming up fast. Rhonda clutched the door handle until her bloodless knuckles went white. She flung her other arm across her eyes to blot out the sight of certain death.<br><br>With a quick heel-toe Duke downshifted, mashed the brakes, and swung the wheel right for all he was worth. Great clouds smoke billowed behind them and the smell of burnt rubber and exhaust stung their nostrils. Rhonda's stomach dropped. One of the tires kissed the cliff's edge before climbing back up on solid ground and onto the road that continued up past an unseen bend.<br><br>Her screams broke into mad peels of hysterical laughter. "Oh Duke! You're nuts you know that?! Absolutely nuts!" She leaned over to kiss his cheek. "And you sure do know how to warm up a motor," she said into his ear close enough he could feel her lips graze across them.<br><br>"It's easy," Duke said back. "It's all about having the right touch- knowing <span class="wordsDot" id="read_words__500"></span> when to drop the hammer and when to ease up."<br><br>"Mm, I don't think I ever want you to ease up."<br><br>Duke looked over to her. Rhonda's soft features looked so right in the pale moonlight. Her full lips, her wild curls billowing everywhere. Her breasts straining the buttons of her blouse. He leaned over to plant a kiss on cheek.<br><br>"Watch out!" she cried raising a finger towards the road ahead. Duke was braking and swerving out of reflex before his eyes could make sense of the road ahead.<br><br>"What is it?" he asked.<br><br>"I... I don't know. Some kind of animal I guess." Her brow furrowed briefly, then she shook her head. "Anyhow, is this place coming up soon or what?"<br><br>"Sure," said Duke. "In fact we're practically there." Sure enough around the next bend a dirt drive veered off from the paved road, forming a sort of crooked "Y." Duke eased up on the gas and took the turnoff. The dirt road cut through a thick swath of trees before opening up to a small overlook. There beyond a small guardrail, the whole island was laid out like an oil painting of breathing serenity. The tires crunched to a gentle halt and the purring <span class="wordsDot" id="read_words__700"></span> motor cut out. Now there was just stillness, silence, and sweet salty air.<br><br>"Mm," Rhonda hummed. She closed her eyes, breathing in the moment as her heartbeat calmed. Then she laughed sweetly. "Wow Duke, you were right about this place."<br><br>"I'm right about a lot of things," Duke smiled. He stretched his arm around her shoulders. And the best part is, it looks like we've got the whole place to ourselves." He crushed his lips into hers in a passionate kiss. She melted into his arms and kissed back all tongue and shudders of warmth rising up from every part of her body. Her slender fingers cradled his taught neck. Her fingernails scratched down his back. His calloused hands grazed her belly and climbed their way up beneath her blouse, reaching the soft, yielding flesh of her breasts. Her nipples hardened. She reached down his pants and found him hard and stiff. Sometime in the mad frenzy of hands and tongue, arms and legs they found themselves in the backseat. Duke slid her skirt up high and pulled her panties to one side. Waves of pleasure crashed over her body like breakers across a ship on a stormy sea. His fingers found her clit and she writhed beneath his touch. Her breath caught in her throat as he slid his throbbing manhood easily into her wanting chalice. Again and again they kissed and writhed, as one panting beast wild with lust. Their passions melted. Rose. Crested. Exploded into a thunderclap of ecstasy. And rolled gently back.<br><br>Rhonda stretched out upon the back seat and caught her breath looking up into an endless pool of twinkling stars. Duke shook two cigarettes from the case. He lit them both and offered Rhonda one.<br><br>"My God! And I thought there <span class="wordsDot" id="read_words__1000"></span> was nothing to do on this old rock." Rhonda exhaled the words with her smoke. Her eyes met Duke's. She could see her own moonlit reflection over the deep dark of his eyes. Her hand cradled his cheek. "I love you Duke."<br><br>"I love you too Rhonda," Duke said, planting a soft kiss on her soft wet lips. It tasted like ash and paradise.<br><br>"Duke, can I ask you something?" They were dressed now and finishing the last few drags of their cigarettes sitting on the hood of the car. Duke had his arm around Rhonda's slender shoulder. She rested her head on against him and her hand on his leg. The hood was warm beneath her and the breeze felt cool against the sweat of her scalp.<br><br>"Fire away," he smiled.<br><br>"Do you see a future with us?" she asked. "I mean, after this summer and all?"<br><br>"What are you talking about?" Duke said. "Of course I do." He turned to her and lifted her chin with his finger. He saw a tear run quietly down her cheek. "Listen Rhonda, I talked to my uncle about pulling more hours at the surf shop. He's going to have an opening pretty soon. When I save up enough dough, we're taking the first boat off this nothing little rock. So all you need to worry about is where you want to go." He leaned in and gave her ear a playful bite. She laughed and sniffed.<br><br>"I guess... I guess California sounds nice."<br><br>"California huh?" Duke said kissing her neck. "Where about?"<br><br>"I don't know. LA?"<br><br>"I don't know. Sounds pretty dangerous. You're liable to get picked up by some big movie producer. He'll whisk you away to fame and stardom, then I'll never see you again."<br><br>"You dummy!" she laughed. "That's half the plan, only you're coming with me. See, I'll play the queen of the Amazons and you'll be the villain's one of the evil henchmen."<br><br>"Oh, will I? Mm. I don't know about that. But I do know I've gotta piss like a racehorse." He slid off the hood of the car. "Don't run off signing any contracts while I'm gone."<br><br>Duke steeped from the overlook into the woods. He waded through the underbrush until he found a suitable bush. Feeling of relief washed over him as he unzipped and unleashed a stream all over the dripping leaves of the bush. As the sound of his urine ceased, another sound from behind startled him. It was darker under the cover of the trees. Duke strained his eyes but it was hard hard to make out anything but the swaying of the branches in the breeze.<br><br>Behind him a branch snapped. Duke pulled out his switchblade and back slowly towards the clearing where the Mustang was parked.<br><br>"Duke!" Rhonda called. "Duke, what's wrong? Did a tree offer you a bit part in some cut rate production?"<br><br>"Shh! I thought I heard something."<br><br>Rhonda listened. Sure enough, there was a sound coming from somewhere in the woods. A strange sound- like a group of people. A rainfall of footsteps. It was getting louder and louder. Approaching at an alarming rate. As if heading straight towards them. "Duke, come on. Let's get out of here!"<br><br>Duke's eyes were wide as saucers. He was already running back to the Mustang when something burst forth through the treeline and out into the clearing. It was something so bizarre, Rhonda's mind couldn't register what it was. It was a tangle of legs and arms. A hulking mass descending upon Duke. It brought a fist like a boulder down on Duke's back with a terrible cracking sound. Rhonda screamed. Duke struggled onto his hands and knees. In this wild, frenzied moment, Rhonda thought the abomination now menacing her love bore a striking resemblance to something she had seen before. But her mind was awash in panic and primal fear. She scrambled into the driver's seat. The keys were still in the ignition. She cranked the motor just as Duke dodged another blow from the creature's terrible fist.<br><br>He grabbed his switchblade from off the ground and thrust it into the creature with all his might. It glanced off it's hide like raindrop off a window pane. Rhonda had never driven a stick shift. The car stalled before she could get it into first gear. "DUKE!" she screamed.<br><br>The creature opened it's hand. No! it's claw. Duke ran with all his might. The beast thrust out its claw and snapped them shut with Duke inside. Blood splattered everywhere. Drops of it fell like a soft rain over Rhonda and the car. When the claw released it's grasp, Duke fell like a rag doll nearly severed in half and lay lifeless in a pool of blood.<br><br>Now a second creature emerged from the clearing.<br><br>This time Rhonda did not scream. Could not scream. Reality seemed to fall out. All sound fell away. All sound was from deep underwater. All reality was seen through a soap opera camera with unreal fluidity to its motion. It didn't seem like it was happening to Rhonda when the creature swung itself towards the she and the car. It didn't seem possible when it stepped with over Dukes articulated rubber body and lunged towards the car.<br><br>It seemed someone else was operating her hands and limbs when she turned the key. She managed to get the Mustang into reverse. When she laid her foot on the gas and peeled backwards down the drive to towards the main road. She lost control on the hair pin turn.<br><br>Reality came screaming back when the car crunched against the steep mountain wall and the airbag slammed itself against her face.<br><br>Things were in and out from there. She was in the car. She was out of the car. Terrible pain. All pain. Something coming. A rock in her fist. Being lifted high into the air. Trashing. Beating with rock. Slipping. All dark.<br><br><span class="wordsDot" id="chapter__2"></span><span class="title">Chapter 2 - Outside, a Pool of Blood</span><br><br>Tom:<br><br>The motel room was dark. A harsh ray of fluorescent street lamp light peeked around the drab blackout <span class="wordsDot" id="read_words__2000"></span> curtains that were a bit too short to cover the room's single window. Barely illuminated by this, a few empty beer cans and crumpled clothes lay where they had fallen. A laptop lay open but dormant on a small press-board table. In the middle of the room was a spring mattress queen bed. Beneath the stained and crumpled sheets a man lay naked and sprawled as though he'd fallen off a horse- snoring softly.<br><br>A bright light stabbed through the darkness as a cell phone on the nightstand screamed to life. It rang twice and vibrated halfway off the table before the man reached over and squinted into the face of it. "NEWS!" read the caller ID. The time read 3:33am. The man took a sharp inhale and pressed the green button. "Yeah?" he croaked. The voice on the other end of the line spoke for a moment. The man knit his brow. "Christ! Where?" he said sitting bolt upright. "No, no. I'll be right there." He hung up the call, snapped on the table lamp, and grabbed a shirt and pants from off the floor. He quickly dressed. He stuffed the laptop in his bag. Leaving the light on, he exited the room.<br><br>Outside was a second story landing of stained concrete. Rows of cheap hollow-core doors lead to dozens of identical rooms. The man descended the stairs steps at a time. He was jogging across the parking lot when a gruff voice from behind called to him.<br><br>"Hey, Walter Cronkite! What's the big story-Is the volcano finally gonna blow?" It came from a gruff man in his late 50s, wearing a dirty tank top.<br><br>"Buy an issue today, Puco! It'll be on the cover," said the reporter. He leapt into a sun weathered Plymouth Valiant. He cranked it a few times before it came to life. Then he gunned it and left the parking lot with tires screeching.<br><br>He flew through the a couple yellow lights and one red on the way to his destination. His phone rang again. This time he answered without checking the caller ID. "This is Tom... Gladys,I-... Yes, he just told me... I'm already on my way... Tell him I'll have the initial report for the website in half an hour... yes... okay bye."<br><br>Tom made his way from the cheap district through midtown and turned off to climb up the winding road leading up into the mountains. He followed the winding road until his way was blocked by a short row of cars and two 18 wheelers parked in the road. He abandoned his car in the middle of the road behind them and walked the rest of the way.<br><br>The scene ahead flashed red and blue in the light of three police cars. The street was already cordoned off with yellow tape. A tall uniformed officer raised a hand to stop Tom as he approached. Tom flashed a press pass and crouched under the tape.<br><br>"No photos," the officer said.<br><br>Just ahead a cherry red Mustang was smashed against the mountainside, trunk first. The driver's side door was open. Inside the cab, airbags hung limp like deflated party balloons. Outside a pool of blood on the asphalt was labeled with a small yellow marker with a big black number on both sides. Another marker sat in a strange dark liquid. It must have been a hell of a rear-end collision, Tom thought.<br><br>"Was the other car removed?" Tom asked the tall officer.<br><br>"Was no other car," said the tall officer.<br><br>Tom frowned at the crunched metal then the pool of blood and the blue puddle. "What about the bodies?"<br><br>"One body," said the officer. He jerked a thumb up in the direction of an unpaved side road. "Most of one, anyway."<br><br>Through the trees, Tom could see more red and blue lights. He followed the path. A half dozen uniformed cops crawled around the area, some shining flashlights through the nearby thickets. In the center of the clearing was a white sheet covering something large. Tom approached the closest officer to it and flashed his press badge again. This one was short and looked much younger.<br><br>"What's the story?" Tom asked.<br><br>The officer shook his head. "All we know is the car belonged to him," the young officer gestured towards the sheet. "It started off there," pointing to the overlook "and tire tracks lead back out to where that car is. My guess is he wasn't driving it."<br><br>"How's that?"<br><br>"He's..." the young officer paused as if searching for words. "You want to see him?"<br><br>Tom nodded gravely. The officer pulled back the sheet. At first it didn't register what Tom was looking at. When it did, bile rose to his mouth. He recoiled and turned away. The officer laid the sheet back down.<br><br>"Looks like the collar bone is all that's holding the two halves of him together," the young officer said.<br><br>"Any idea how this could've happened?"<br><br>The young officer shook his head. "You beat the coroner here. You'll have to wait for him to say."<br><br>"What about whoever left that blood back there?" Tom motioned to the crashed car on the street.<br><br>"GODDAMMIT!" a shrill voice cried from that same direction. "Someone want to tell me why the hell we're letting a cheap muckraker crawl around an active crime scene?!" A corpulent blob of a man sauntered into the clearing. He was wearing a uniform as well that appeared a few sizes too small. Tom immediately felt sorry for the poor buttons straining on that shirt.<br><br>"You want to go back to pushing pencils in a cubicle downtown?" the portly man said to the young officer. Even in the flashing lights, Tom could see the man's jowly face was red. A shock of white hair formed a moustache swimming in all that angry face.<br><br>"No sir, Chief," said the young officer.<br><br>"Get this hack out of here," said the Chief.<br><br>"Tom Dickenharry. You must be Chief Stache. I don't believe we've formally met," Tom smiled. He reached his hand for a handshake he knew was coming.<br><br>"You could be Shirley-Fucking-Temple for all I care. If you don't <span class="wordsDot" id="read_words__3000"></span> get the fuck outta here right fucking now, I'm booking your ass for obstruction." His beady eyes told Tom it was true.<br><br>With a nod, Tom went back to his car. He pulled out his laptop. He began typing up a quick report for the Online Edition of the paper. He closed the laptop. Then he fired up the car, and flipped it around.<br><br>This time, Tom obeyed the traffic laws on his way to the office. Sunrise was still a few hours out. Tom passed few cars on his way down the mountain. Any one of them could have contained the coroner. But probably not the Corvette Stingray purring it's way up the mountain road. At least, not unless the coroner had recently had a three-quarter life crisis.<br><br><span class="wordsDot" id="chapter__3"></span><span class="title">Chapter 3 - On Her Folk’s Dime</span><br><br>Paula:<br><br>The midnight blue Stingray's tires hugged the pavement as the car climbed steep the mountain road. They were guided by a pair of gloved hands attached feminine arms that deftly handled the twists and turns.<br><br>Paula glanced in the rear view mirror. She was wearing a tan trench coat and a dark fedora. Even in the dark, she preferred to wear shades. She wore knee high equestrian boots. Her lipstick was fire engine red. When she reached a wall of stopped cars in the right hand lane, she crossed the double yellow lines. She drove against the flow up traffic up the left hand lane. Not that there was any traffic. The road ahead was certainly blocked.<br><br>When she reached the police tape, she parked in the street and got out of the car. A tall uniformed cop raised a hand to stop her.<br><br>"Road's closed, ma'am" he said. "No press either," he added.<br><br>"Don't sweat it, Jack" she said. "I'm no hack. I'm a shamus. Here on business." She flashed a badge showing she was a licensed private investigator. The badge was under the lapel of her trench coat pinned to one of her ample breasts. The tall officer hesitated, then waved her through. She crossed under the tape and pulled out a pen and pad. She let out a low whistle when she looked at the car, splattered with blood.<br><br>"What's the story, pops?" she asked motioning to the wreck.<br><br>The tall officer shrugged. "Sometime between two and three AM somebody hit it hard going backwards. Came from over there." He pointed to a dirt road up ahead. "Body's been ripped in half. Almost."<br><br>"That body didn't happen belong to an 18 year old girl, did it?" Paula said."That's who I'm looking for."<br><br>The tall officer shook his head. "White male. Black hair. Around 5'10". The coroner hasn't shown yet, so we don't have an ID on the body." Paula took notes while the tall officer spoke.<br><br>"You don't mind if I take a look at the stiff, do you?" she asked.<br><br>"I don't think that's a good idea. The chief's up there now and he doesn't want any snooping."<br><br>"Don't sweat it, Jack. I'll be so fast he won't even know I'm here."<br><br>The officer opened his mouth to protest, but Paula was already halfway there.<br><br>The white sheet over the body glowed eerily in the moonlight. Paula lifted the corner and gagged. From the smell, it was clear the lower intestines had ruptured. She covered her nose and mouth with a handkerchief from her back pocket and tried again. She studied the contorted face pressing into the sandy soil.<br><br>"Who the fuck are you?" came a high pitched rasp from behind.<br><br>"Easter bunny," said Paula. "I thought I might have left a few eggs under this sheet."<br><br>"Oh, that's cute," Chief Stache said. "JOHNSON! I thought I told you to shore up that line. For fuck's sake, this a homicide scene! And it's got more hole than a French whore!"<br><br>"Don't bust your hernia, Jack," said Paula. She flashed the badge again. "I'm here about a girl. I'm on her folk's dime. They got the idea she might've run off with a guy. Maybe this guy." She motioned to the corpse with her head.<br><br>"You might run off and wait for the report this afternoon," Chief Stache said. Then chuckled: "Christ. Hiring a woman as a private dick. Now I've seen everything."<br><br>"Bet you ain't seen yours since the Clinton administration," Paula muttered.<br><br>"What's that?" said Stache.<br><br>"I said I'm sure you boys will have all this figured out before us girls even start cooking our husbands' dinner. I'm blowing this joint."<br><br>Stache's face turned a deep red. "You stay the fuck outta this case," he said.<br><br>If she'd heard, she didn't show any sign of it. Paula was already walking away.<br><br>"Johnson!" yelled Stache. "Escort her out."<br><br>The tall officer came up to her. "You heard the Chief," he said. "Let's not make trouble."<br><br>"I wouldn't dream of it," she said. They were almost to the tape that read "Police line- do not cross" (and eye of Chief Stache's field of view) when she said, "Oh, one thing! I forgot to grab this license plate number."<br><br>The tall officer glanced over his shoulder to see if Stache was looking. "Okay. But be quick about it."<br><br>Paula walked over to the wrecked car. The license plate was smashed almost flat against the rocks of the mountain. She had to kneel beside the mangled heap to get a good look. Just then something caught her eye. It was very small and blinking red.<br><br>"Hello," she said. "What do we have here?"<br><br>"JOHNSON!" called Stache's shrill voice called.<br><br>"Hey lady-" began the officer.<br><br>"I'm coming," she said. She pocketed the small object, made a quick note of the plate number, and left under the tape.<br><br>Back in her car, she pulled out her phone and dialed. While it rang, she pulled the blinking red object out of her pocket and examined it. It a small, flat circle with a half dozen tiny hooks on the bottom. On the top was just a small red light blinking in a slow rhythm. The person on the other end answered the call.<br><br>"Hey," she said. "It's me. No sign of her yet. I just found the guy though... No. He's <span class="wordsDot" id="read_words__4000"></span> dead... I don't know how. I've got couple new ends to work. Listen, I'm not going to sugar coat it. I think she could be in serious trouble. I say we cast a wide net. This thing wouldn't stay under wraps if we tied it up with an steel bow. Besides that's not going to help us find her now... Uh-huh... yes... Well, here's what I propose. I reach out to the press. They'll be all over this like white on rice anyway and might kick up something that'll help us find her. And the more people looking for her right now the better... Report her missing to the fuzz if you want. Off the record I wouldn't trust the cops in this town to bag my groceries. But then any resources we can pull help. Okay then. I'll call you when I've got more." She hung up the call.<br><br>She chewed her lip for a moment, turning the strange round device over and over in her gloved hand. Then she dialed another number. It was after hours, but she knew they'd pick up. Sure enough, after three rings someone picked up.<br><br>"Hello... Hi Gladys... Listen, I'm a shamus with dope on murder case. Let me talk to the big boss over there... yes, I'll hold." She revved the car and turned it back down the mountain, descending at a steady pace. A man picked up and introduced himself. "... Hi Dirk. Listen, I'll make this fast. A girl's missing. Gone two days. Name's Rhonda Rodes. Look her up. She was the dead guy's beau. And I've been hired to find her... Uh-huh... Here's what I want. You give me everything you can find on her and her whereabouts and I'll give you the all my dope- exclusive! How about it?... Swell. Take this number down." She gave her number. "Now, you get anything you bring it to me first. If I find you printing anything I don't know about, deal's off. Savvy?" She hung up.<br><br>It was still dark, the moonlight shining down like silver rain. On a sharp turn at the base of the mountain, she cut the wheel hard to the right. Her sleeve hiked up her arm, revealing a thick swath of black hair.<br><br><span class="wordsDot" id="chapter__4"></span><span class="title">Chapter 4 - A Pop of Cheer</span><br><br>Tom:<br><br>The architectural inspiration for The Island Eye newspaper's main (and only) office may well have been a shoebox. The exterior was a sun-bleached tan. The interior was a celebration of dark wood grain and mustard yellow penny tile. If computers were all replaced with typewriters, one might get the impression they'd stepped through a time portal and landed in 1970.<br><br>Though The Island Eye owned the building, half the building was leased to an unrelated staffing agency for office temps. A smaller section was leased to a screen printing company to put logos on mugs and T-shirts. The Eye probably made more leasing out these offices than it did selling papers, Tom had once mused.<br><br>The small remaining section still used by the Eye was the only one with lights on at this hour. This is where Tom headed when he arrived.<br><br>A couple bleary eyed employees were hunched over keyboards on the low-partitioned cubicles of the office floor. Tom stopped off in the break room. He poured himself a Styrofoam cupful of acrid black coffee. Then he headed for the back.<br><br>"Good morning, Gladys," said Tom. Gladys's desk sat in front of a door lettered "Dirk Daily- Editor in Chief."<br><br>"Good morning, Tom," she said. It was the earliest in the morning Tom had ever seen Gladys. Her hair was piled atop her head in a messy bun. She was wearing no makeup and crows feet wrinkled in the corner of her eyes as she shone him a sad smile. "You missed a button," she added.<br><br>Tom looked down and saw that indeed, one half his shirt was six inches below the other. He thanked her and corrected it. He remembered he had- indeed- gotten dressed in the dark.<br><br>"I read your blurb. It sounds like there was something you couldn't print" she asked.<br><br>"Looks like someone ripped him in half. There was a lot of blood. They either left or got taken away before the cops came. There was some blood there, too.<br><br>I couldn't get much. Jolly old Saint Nick wasn't too happy about me nosing around. "<br><br>Gladys shuddered. "It's just awful. Do you think it was murder?"<br><br>"He didn't do it to himself, that's for sure. My guess is whoever crashed the Mustang was getting away from whoever or whatever did THAT. After they crashed I don't know. Hopefully the coroner will be able to ID the body soon and we'll have more to go on."<br><br>"It's just awful," she repeated. "All this death and murder business. It seems people can't wait to read all about it. Not just to be informed, I mean. For kicks!" She sipped her own Styrofoam cup of coffee, light in color from cream and sugar. "Dirk says this'll sell more papers than any issue in the last five years."<br><br>Tom nodded. It was probably true.<br><br>Gladys narrowed gaze at him. "Are you taking care of yourself? Still staying at that place?"<br><br>"I'm getting by."<br><br>"Tom," her voice dropped to a whisper, "it's been six months. Don't you think it's time you put yourself out there? You don't look half bad when you clean up. Meet some girls. Have some dates. It'd be good for you."<br><br>"Yeah."<br><br>"I mean it Tom. Moping around won't bring her back."<br><br>"I don't want her back, I... Look, I'm fine Gladys. Really."<br><br>The phone on Gladys's desk beeped. She pressed a button and picked up the receiver.<br><br>"He'll see you now," she said.<br><br>Tom nodded. He swigged the last bit of coffee in his cup and entered Dirk's office.<br><br>***<br><br>Dirk Daily sat behind a dated rectangular desk that was right at home in the dated rectangular building. A beach themed calendar, plaques, awards, and photos of Dirk shaking hands with people adorned the wood paneled walls. Besides the calendar, everything was more than five <span class="wordsDot" id="read_words__5000"></span> years old. A plastic ficus gathering dust in the corner struggled to add a pop of cheer to the room.<br><br>On the desk, a landline phone was flickering with red and orange lights. (Tom had never once seen Dirk use a cellular.) Behind the desk sat Dirk- a frenzy of wild energy in human form. By appearances it was hard to tell if he'd stayed working late or come in very early. His salt and pepper crew cut shot up as if it had been electrified. His bushy eyebrows, still jet black as ever- arched above two striking, if slightly bloodshot, eyes. The sleeves of his white shirt were rolled to the elbows. His red tie hung slack around his unbuttoned collar. His blazer had been discarded on the back of his chair.<br><br>Dirk didn't seem to notice Tom. He was transfixed on the ancient computer monitor before him.<br><br>"You wanted to see me sir?" Tom said.<br><br>"Tom!" he said. "Yes! Sit!" Dirk gestured for a chair. "You look like hell."<br><br>"Thanks."<br><br>"I got your piece from earlier. Christ! This is going to a media frenzy." Dirk tossed back a cup of coffee. His was in a proper mug. A promotional giveaway mug which bore the logo of a local law firm. Tom idly wondered if it was printed in the offices next door. "This is going to move more papers than any story Dath Island's seen since those shark attacks in '93." Dirk gazed wistfully at one of the plaques on the wall. "You know about the girl?"<br><br></div>
